# How to create a Table bar item for RibbonControl


<p>This example demonstrates  how to create a custom TableBarItem for RibbonControl without creating RibbonControl descendants. </p><br />
<p>To  implement this item, we executed the following steps : </p><p> 1) created a custom BarItem descendant</p><p> 2) created a BarAndDockingController descendant with an overridden RegisterPaintStyles method to register your BarItem at design time</p><br />
<p>To add  this functionality to your project, add  all files from the TableBarItem folder. </p><p>Then,  drop the MyBarAndDockingController  and RibbonControl components onto a Form  and set the  RibbonController's Controller property to your custom controller and rebuild the solution. </p><p>After that TableBarItem becomes available in the Ribbon context menu you can add it to the required group. </p><br />
<p>Additionally, you can place a custom UserControl under the table control. To do this, use the InnerPopupControl property.  So, you need to place the existing UserControl onto the form or create a new one and pass it to the InnerPopupControl  property.</p>
